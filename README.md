# zkSync-test-proj
This is my first zkSync era dApp. It was build on testnet. The smart-contract adress on block explorer: [0xF7087df5b2A49205d43A8B3B7bc32b0C28C45179](https://goerli.explorer.zksync.io/address/0xF7087df5b2A49205d43A8B3B7bc32b0C28C45179)
This is a simple smart contract, that let you change the output on the page. Sceenshots below.

So basically me made a transaction that changes value of variable `_greeting`. We can see it on explorer by Transaction hash 0xe7a246616012bde16d026717071317ca54b7f9d212398e1588a2e2875cb6ed50 or [this link](https://goerli.explorer.zksync.io/tx/0xe7a246616012bde16d026717071317ca54b7f9d212398e1588a2e2875cb6ed50)

Here is the general info, for example we can see on in which block the transaction took place, and we can look at it if its needed. Block number `12600927` , we can search it on explorer or visit [this link](https://goerli.explorer.zksync.io/block/12600927)

Also,  it is worth adding to the screenshot where general information about the transaction was shown, that we can both view the current value of `_greeting` and change its value directly in the smart contract on ***Explorer***. To do this, go to the ***Contract*** and click ***Read*** or ***Write***, depending on what we need.
